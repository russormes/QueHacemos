MY OOP php page for viewing fb events

A small web app that allows you to log in to your fb account and view all events from pages that you like in a single feed. It is intended to be used as the base for a bigger app that will list cultural events occurring in the local city. 

Primarily it is me getting reacquainted with OOP.
